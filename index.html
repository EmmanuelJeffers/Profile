            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my personal website! 
                I'm a passionate and dedicated Computer Information Systems student at New York City College of Technology, 
                currently on track to graduate in June 2024. 
                With a solid foundation laid during my time at John Dewey High School, 
                where I earned an Advanced Regents Diploma, 
                I've delved deep into software engineering, 
                robotics, and various extracurricular activities. 
                As an active participant in FIRST Robotics Teams, 
                I've honed my skills as a Lead Programmer, 
                guiding teams through challenges and competitions. 
                Beyond academics, I've gained invaluable real-world experience through internships with organizations like the NYC Department of Education and Research Foundation CUNY, 
                where I've managed equipment inventory systems, provided technical support, and assisted in curriculum development. 
                My dedication extends to mentoring, volunteering, and contributing to community projects, reflecting my commitment to teamwork, communication, and critical thinking. 
                Proficient in languages like Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                coupled with strong organizational and problem-solving abilities, 
                I'm eager to leverage my skills and experiences to make meaningful contributions in the world of technology.
